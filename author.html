      <h1>Hi, my name is <a href="reidhansel.com">Reid Hansell</a></h1>
      <p>
        I started this blog to master the things I've learned on my journey in
        software development and also to guide those who are beginning theirs.
        My biggest frustration with coding has been the lack of direction. My
        aim is to give direction, share my experiences, and provide quality,
        beginner-friendly resources.

        What does "crashed successfully" mean? Failure can either be looked at
        as a negative thing or an opportunity to improve. Repeated failure, or
        crashes, are necessary to become great. My approach to learning is to
        dive right in and start making mistakes.

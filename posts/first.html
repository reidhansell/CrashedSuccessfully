        To start I would like to suggest that you make a GitHub. If you've
        already done this, skip to the next paragraph. For those who don't know,
        Git/GitHub is the most widely use “version control system” currently
        available. A version control system is a way to save a project in one
        place and have multiple people work on it without breaking the whole
        thing. Again, I highly suggest making a GitHub account and spending a
        day learning how it works. I will supply resources at the bottom of the
        article.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a GitHub it is time to start your project. Create it on
        GitHub and clone it to your computer. When I made my portfolio I
        implemented a blog into it; so naturally I decided my first project
        would be to make the blog into its own thing. Having learned a little
        bit of HTML and CSS, I decided it was time to learn JavaScript. Lucky
        for me I had learned Java in college so making the switch wasn't
        terribly difficult. JavaScript is what makes websites into interactive
        programs rather than static data displays. This will likely be the
        hardest part of your journey into software development but the payoff is
        huge.
      </p>
      <p>
        How should you pick your first project? Well, the goal is to make it
        interactive. A classic pick is a shopping list with an input form and a
        submit button that adds an item to a shopping list. Another idea is
        making a “night mode” for your portfolio where you click a button and
        the background/text changes color. Anything that involves the user
        interacting with the website through JavaScript. A blog was an
        interesting pick for me. Without knowing what a single-page-application
        was, I essentially made one out of vanilla JavaScript which made it load
        instantaneously. Not only did I get to practice a little JavaScript but
        my website also got faster which was cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        After I had a working blog that used JavaScript I decided to go back to
        my portfolio and make some changes, add features, and of course, add the
        blog to my list of projects. I kept improving my two creations through
        design and features. In my next blog post I will be talking about my
        experience learning real front-end development skills like design.
        Thanks for reading.

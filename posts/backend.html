      <h1>Making your project full-stack</h1>
      <h3>A brief introduction to back end development</h3>
      <h5 style="color: gray;">09 - 22 - 19</h5>
      <p>
        Back end development can seem intimidating to those who haven't done it
        yet, but there's no reason for that. Back end development, in my
        opinion, is only considered harder because you aren't seeing change
        happen on the screen. It requires just a little bit more patience. Most
        of the internet is made up of C.R.U.D. applications which stands for
        create, read, update, and delete. To summarize this kind of application
        in one sentence, it can take data from the user, store it in a data
        base, edit the data, and return it to the user. For those new to
        development, I highly suggest making one as an intro to full stack or
        back end development.

        For example, I made a fitness tracker with React. However, whenever I
        refreshed the page all of my exercises and workouts were gone. What I
        wanted to make was something you could log into from anywhere in order
        to log your exercises. In order to learn the skills to do so I followed
        along with Traversy Media's M.E.R.N. stack series which was about 13
        hours of video, most of which I had to watch twice or pause to catch up
        with coding. Whichever stack you pick isn't terribly important but it
        should sync well with the front end framework you are using. Your stack
        will likely include Node.js, a modern back end also made with JavaScript
        (previously unheard of).

        Think of a way to make your stack a full stack project and begin using
        your resources to learn the skills to do so. Do not under any
        circumstance just copy a tutorial and decide you've learned the skills.
        Apply it to your own project in some way, shape, or form. In my eyes,
        making a full stack project earns you your official developer badge. It
        doesn't necessarily mean you're a good developer, but you've taken off
        the training wheels. Now that I've covered how I learned to code I will
        begin posting about how I am becoming a better developer. Topics will
        include security, comments, optimization, and more. Thanks for reading.
